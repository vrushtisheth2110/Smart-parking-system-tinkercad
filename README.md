# Smart-parking-system

The Smart Parking System is an Arduino‑based project designed to automate vehicle entry, exit, and slot detection in a parking area. It uses IR sensors to monitor cars at the entry gate, exit gate, and individual parking slots, while servo motors control the gates to open and close automatically. A 16x2 LCD display provides real‑time feedback to users by showing whether each slot is available or not, making the system simple and user‑friendly. When a car arrives at the entry, the IR sensor detects it and the entry gate opens for a short duration before closing again. As the car moves into a slot, the corresponding IR sensor updates the slot status from “Available” to “Not Available” on the LCD. Similarly, when a car leaves through the exit, the exit gate opens and the slot is freed, updating the LCD back to “Available.” This process ensures that users always know the current occupancy of the parking area. The project demonstrates how low‑cost components like Arduino, IR sensors, servo motors, and LCDs can be combined to build a practical solution for managing parking spaces efficiently. It is particularly useful in places such as malls, offices, and residential complexes where space is limited and real‑time monitoring is essential. The system is modular, scalable, and can be expanded to handle more slots with minimal changes, making it a strong foundation for smart city infrastructure.
